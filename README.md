Brian Huot - Forms Demo

A demonstration of forms seeking to fill the project requirements of <code>LOUISVILLE.

The site consists of an original form that asks for the user's name, e-mail address, and tournaments attended by month. After selecting those, it generates identical response fields for each tournament month and a final Submit button that would ultimately submit responses.
